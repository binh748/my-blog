Hello! I'm Binh (he/him). I'm working toward my goal of becoming the best data scientist I can be.

I completed the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) NYC data science bootcamp in summer 2020. Before Metis, I worked on the trading floor of [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/) as a member of the portfolio financing team.

My favorite anime is [Stars Align (星合の空)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37972/Hoshiai_no_Sora), and I hope there will be a season 2. I'm also looking forward to [The Promised Neverland (約束のネバーランド) season 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39617/Yakusoku_no_Neverland_2nd_Season).

I graduated from [Yale University](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/) with a B.A. in humanities.
