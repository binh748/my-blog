Hi, I'm Binh (he/him)! I'm transitioning into data science from finance. I completed the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) NYC summer data science bootcamp in 2020. Before jumping into data science, I worked on the trading floor of [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/) as a member of the portfolio financing team.

In my free time, I'm a community organizer with [GAPIMNY](http://gapimny.org/), a NYC queer and trans Asian Pacific Islander community organization.

My favorite anime is [Stars Align (星合の空)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37972/Hoshiai_no_Sora).

I graduated from [Yale University](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/) with a B.A. in humanities. Here's my [resume](https://github.com/binh748/resume/blob/main/Binh-Hoang-Resume2.7.pdf).
