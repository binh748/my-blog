I'm a data scientist transitioning from finance. Before jumping into data science, I worked on the trading floor of [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/) as a member of the portfolio financing team.

Clear and informative data visualizations make me happy. It's one of the reasons I love data science.

In my free time, I'm a community organizer with [GAPIMNY](http://gapimny.org/), a NYC queer and trans Asian Pacific Islander community organization.

I graduated from [Yale University](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/) with a B.A. in humanities.
