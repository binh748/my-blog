Hello! I'm Binh (he/him). I'm working to become the best data scientist I can be.

I completed the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) NYC data science bootcamp in summer 2020. Before Metis, I worked on the trading floor of [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/) as a member of the portfolio financing team.

I graduated from [Yale University](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/) with a B.A. in humanities.

## What do I enjoy outside of data science?

My favorite anime is [Stars Align (星合の空)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37972/Hoshiai_no_Sora), and I hope there will be a season 2. Right now I'm really enjoying the anime [Kemono Jihen (怪物事変)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40908/Kemono_Jihen).  

I'm learning Japanese and also practicing my Vietnamese, and I hope to learn Chinese, too, in the future. ^-^
