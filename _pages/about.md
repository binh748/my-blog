Hello! I'm Binh (he/him). I'm working to become the best data scientist I can be.

I'm currently a Data Analyst in the data team at [DailyPay](https://www.dailypay.com/). DailyPay is growing fast, so if you're interested in one of [the many job openings](https://boards.greenhouse.io/dailypayinc), feel free to reach out.  

I completed the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) NYC data science bootcamp in summer 2020. Before Metis, I worked on the trading floor of [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/) as a member of the portfolio financing team.

I graduated from [Yale University](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/) with a B.A. in humanities.

## What do I enjoy outside of data science?

My favorite anime is [Stars Align (星合の空)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37972/Hoshiai_no_Sora), and I hope there will be a season 2. I also recently finished the anime [Kemono Jihen (怪物事変)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40908/Kemono_Jihen) and really hoping there will be a season 2 for that as well. Where are the season 2s for my favorite anime :cry:? 

Right now, I'm learning Japanese using japanesepod101.com and also trying to keep up my Vietnamese. I hope to one day learn Chinese, too. ^-^
